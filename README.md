The first versions of Dknowledge are intended to start collaborators and stakeholders in the Drayker ecosystem and in the future will be a structured database aimed at making all the knowledge generated by Drayker and Dk more accessible.

Dknowledge will also be the basis for all Dk data, sensors, files, oracles, processes and ontologies, with public, federated, and private data.
