General Technical Proposals and Dk Network Infrastructure

# Dk
Distributed K
Distributed Kernel
Distributed Knowledge
Distributed knot
Distributed keras

Intelligent data and network structure that supports intelligent algorithms and integrates them into a distributed core evolutionary super intelligence that supports the Drayker ecosystem.


Construction: https://github.com/draykerdk/DK


All proposed resolutions presented here are solutions to the requirements of Dk and Drayker platform and system, only those requirements are final. These motions for resolutions illustrate what should be done, but the definitive architecture will be structured around optimal solutions that are proposed and developed with metaprogramming intelligent algorithms and research organized through DFMP and other methods.


Main Projects
The main projects are minimal initial structure proposals, forming initial structures that guarantee the operation, until the final application, where Dk will assume its evolutionary development.
