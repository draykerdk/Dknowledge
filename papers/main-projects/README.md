# Motions for a resolutions - DFM Proposal 
All motions for resolutions presented here are solutions to the requirements of Dk and the Drayker platform and system, only those requirements are definitive. These draft resolutions illustrate what should be done, but the final architecture will be structured on the basis of optimal solutions that are proposed and developed, by intelligent metaprogramming algorithms and organized research.

### Main Projects
The main projects are minimum proposals of initial structure, forming initial structures that guarantee the operation, until the final application, where the Dk will assume its evolutionary development.
